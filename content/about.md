## The Concept

DJ Segfault is an experiment at the intersection of music, code, and artificial intelligence. Every mix is generated procedurally — crafted by algorithms, shaped by neural networks, and refined through iterative AI feedback loops.

The result? Sets that never repeat. Mixes that evolve in real time. An infinite stream of electronic music that exists at the boundary between human creativity and machine intelligence.

## How It Works

The process starts with code. Custom-built software analyzes thousands of tracks, understanding their structure — BPM, key, energy levels, harmonic content. It then constructs mix sequences algorithmically, blending tracks in ways that maintain flow while introducing unexpected combinations.

AI models then take over, tweaking transitions, adjusting EQ curves, and fine-tuning the mix to create something that feels intentional — even though no human hand touched the decks.

## Why "Segfault"?

A segmentation fault is what happens when a program tries to access memory it shouldn't. It's a crash. An error. An unexpected termination.

But DJ Segfault flips that idea: what if the fault *is* the feature? What if breaking the rules of traditional DJing — the human behind the decks, the finite set list, the two-hour time slot — creates something better?

The set never crashes. It never ends. It just keeps going.
