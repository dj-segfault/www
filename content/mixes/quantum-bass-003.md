## About This Mix

Quantum Bass 003 pushes the generation engine into heavier territory. The algorithm was configured to maximize low-frequency energy while maintaining musical coherence — a constraint that forced it to develop novel approaches to bass sound design.

The mix exists in a state of constant tension: massive sub frequencies that feel like they're about to overwhelm the signal chain, held in check by precise algorithmic gain staging.

## Technical Details

- **Seed algorithm**: Bass-optimized frequency allocation model v0.7
- **AI refinement**: 89 iterations with spectral balance constraints
- **Source material**: 3,100 bass music stems across dubstep, drum & bass, and halftime
- **Generation time**: 4.1 seconds per hour of output

## Key Characteristics

- Sub-bass frequencies that push the limits of standard monitoring
- Algorithmic wobble synthesis with chaotic modulation sources
- Half-time and double-time switches driven by energy curves
- Sidechain compression patterns generated by neural network
- Harmonic distortion curves shaped by spectral analysis
