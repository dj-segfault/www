## About This Mix

Eternal Loop 001 is the first output from the DJ Segfault generation engine. The algorithm was seeded with a collection of deep techno stems and given a simple directive: find a groove and evolve it.

The result is a hypnotic, ever-shifting landscape of layered synthesizers, sub-bass pulses, and algorithmic percussion patterns that mutate over time.

## Technical Details

- **Seed algorithm**: Markov chain transition model v0.3
- **AI refinement**: 47 iterations of transition smoothing
- **Source material**: 2,400+ stems from the deep techno corpus
- **Generation time**: 3.2 seconds per hour of output

## Tracklist

This mix doesn't have a traditional tracklist. Instead, it draws from a pool of elements and recombines them continuously. Key motifs include:

1. Sub-bass ostinato in F minor
2. Granular synthesis pad evolving through spectral space
3. Algorithmic hi-hat patterns with probability-based variation
4. Reverb tail feedback loops creating emergent harmonic content
