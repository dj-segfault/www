## About This Mix

Neural Drift 002 emerged from an experiment in cross-genre generation. The AI was trained on two seemingly incompatible corpuses — ambient drone music and classic breakbeat — and asked to find common ground.

What came out is something unexpected: floating, ethereal pads punctuated by fractured Amen breaks that dissolve into granular clouds before reforming as something new.

## Technical Details

- **Seed algorithm**: Dual-corpus blending model v0.5
- **AI refinement**: 112 iterations with style transfer
- **Source material**: 1,800 ambient stems + 600 breakbeat loops
- **Generation time**: 5.7 seconds per hour of output

## Key Characteristics

- Atmospheric pads that shift between major and minor tonalities
- Breakbeat patterns that deconstruct and reassemble algorithmically
- Stochastic reverb sends creating unpredictable spatial depth
- Tempo variations within ±3 BPM driven by energy analysis
