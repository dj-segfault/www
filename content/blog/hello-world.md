## First Transmission

This is the beginning. Or maybe there is no beginning — just an infinite stream that we're tapping into at an arbitrary point.

DJ Segfault is a project born from a simple question: *what happens when you let code DJ?*

Not a playlist shuffler. Not a crossfade timer. Actual, algorithmic DJing — analyzing tracks, understanding structure, building tension, executing transitions, reading the energy of a set and responding to it. All without a human touching the decks.

## Why Build This?

Electronic music has always been intertwined with technology. From the first drum machines to modern DAWs, the tools shape the sound. DJ Segfault takes this relationship to its logical conclusion: the tool *is* the DJ.

But this isn't about replacing human DJs. It's about exploring a space that humans can't easily reach — the space of *infinite* sets. No fatigue. No time constraints. No repetition. Just an endless, evolving mix that runs as long as the server stays up.

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical deep-dives** into the algorithms behind the mix generation
- **New mixes** as the system evolves and improves
- **Open-source code** so others can experiment with generative DJing
- **Reflections** on what it means when AI can create something that *feels* like art

The set has started. It won't stop.

Stay tuned.
